## [0.9.4] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Driver-layer base classes for hardware-driver plugins under
  `ados.sdk.drivers`. Covers camera, gimbal, LiDAR, GPS, ESC, and
  payload actuator. Each base ships an abstract class plus frozen
  dataclasses for candidates, capabilities, and per-stream value types.
- Driver error hierarchy (`DriverError`, `DriverDeviceNotFound`,
  `DriverPermissionDenied`) chained under the existing plugin error
  base so driver faults flow through the supervisor's circuit breaker.
- Top-level `ados.sdk` package re-exporting the public driver surface
  for plugin authors.
- Contract tests for the driver base classes covering abstract-ness,
  trivial-subclass instantiability, frozen value types, and error
  hierarchy.
