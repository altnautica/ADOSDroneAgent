# Changelog

All notable changes to the ADOS Drone Agent are recorded here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.9.6] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Two new built-in plugins shipped under `ados.plugins.builtin`.
  `telemetry-logger` subscribes to the public lifecycle topics and
  emits a structured log line per event for journald and operator
  dashboards. `mavlink-inspector` subscribes to vehicle state changes,
  folds them into an in-memory snapshot, and republishes the snapshot
  under its own plugin namespace for diagnostic UIs. Both run inprocess
  under the first-party signer carve-out and serve as worked examples
  for the SDK contract.
- Canonical capability catalog at `ados.plugins.capabilities`.
  Enumerates the 29 named agent permissions a plugin manifest may
  declare. Manifest validation now logs a warning when it sees a
  capability outside the catalog. The catalog is advisory; runtime
  enforcement gates land per surface as the protected subsystem ships.
- Plugin OEM deployment guide at `docs/oem/plugin-deployment.md`.
  Covers signed-archive distribution, signing key registration,
  factory-time install, key revocation rotation, CLI quick reference,
  resource limits, and troubleshooting.
- `tmpfiles.d` rule for `/run/ados/plugins` socket runtime cleanup,
  installed automatically by the install script.
- `--yes` / `-y` flag on `ados plugin perms --revoke` for non-interactive
  use. Default is to prompt before revoking a granted permission.
- IPC capability token expiry is now enforced per request inside the
  supervisor's IPC dispatch loop. Expired tokens return a structured
  `token_expired` error envelope and the request is not routed.

### Changed

- `scripts/install.sh` now provisions the `ados-plugins.slice` cgroup
  parent and the plugin runtime tmpfiles drop-in idempotently during
  install and upgrade. Fresh-flashed SBCs no longer need any manual
  steps to host plugins.
- Three internal-tag comments in `pyproject.toml` rewritten as neutral
  domain comments describing what the configuration does.
- Dev dependencies extended with `msgpack` and `python-multipart` so
  the IPC, RPC, and API plugin test files collect under `pytest`.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- `ados plugin lint` subcommand. Runs static analysis on a `.adosplug`
  archive (banned Python and JavaScript patterns, network imports
  versus declared permissions, vendor-binary flag, signature presence).
  Returns a scored report and exits non-zero on errors. Same rule set
  the registry submission gate will run server-side.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Driver-layer base classes for hardware-driver plugins under
  `ados.sdk.drivers`. Covers camera, gimbal, LiDAR, GPS, ESC, and
  payload actuator. Each base ships an abstract class plus frozen
  dataclasses for candidates, capabilities, and per-stream value types.
- Driver error hierarchy (`DriverError`, `DriverDeviceNotFound`,
  `DriverPermissionDenied`) chained under the existing plugin error
  base so driver faults flow through the supervisor's circuit breaker.
- Top-level `ados.sdk` package re-exporting the public driver surface
  for plugin authors.
- Contract tests for the driver base classes covering abstract-ness,
  trivial-subclass instantiability, frozen value types, and error
  hierarchy.
